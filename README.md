# MovieRecommenderSystem
A movie recommender system is a tool that suggests movies to users based on their preferences or past behavior. This is implemented in Python and deployed as a web application using Streamlit.

Steps to Implement a Movie Recommender System Using Python and Streamlit:

1. Data Collection

2. Data Preprocessing

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

4. Recommender System Approaches

Collaborative Filtering

Content-Based Filtering

5. Model Implementation

6. Streamlit Web Application

7. Model Deployment (yet to be done).
